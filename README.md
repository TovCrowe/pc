## Tech Stack

| Dependency | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Spring Boot 4.0.6** | The framework. Auto-configures everything and runs the app via an embedded Tomcat server — no WAR deployment needed. |
| **Spring Web** | Provides `@RestController`, `@GetMapping`, etc. to build REST endpoints. |
| **Spring Data JPA** | Abstracts database access. You define an interface and Spring generates the SQL queries for you. |
| **Spring Security** | Adds authentication/authorization. Configured with HTTP Basic Auth and a database-backed user store. |
| **Spring Validation** | Lets you annotate entity fields with rules like `@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Email`, etc. |
| **Lombok** | Generates boilerplate Java (getters, setters, constructors) at compile time via annotations. |
| **H2** | An in-memory database used in development. Data is lost when the app stops. |
| **PostgreSQL** | The production database. |

## Spring & Spring Boot Fundamentals

This section is the mental model the rest of the README assumes. Read it once and the annotations everywhere else stop being magic.

### Spring vs. Spring Boot

- **Spring Framework** is the core: an *Inversion of Control (IoC) container* plus modules for web, data, security, etc. On its own, Spring needs a lot of manual configuration (XML or Java config) to wire everything together.
- **Spring Boot** sits on top of Spring and removes that ceremony. It adds **auto-configuration**, **starter dependencies**, and an **embedded server** so you can run a production-grade app with almost no boilerplate.

> Rule of thumb: *Spring gives you the building blocks; Spring Boot assembles them for you with sensible defaults.*

### Inversion of Control & Dependency Injection (the #1 concept)

Normally **your code** creates the objects it needs:

```java
ClientService service = new ClientService(new ClientRepository(...));  // you are in control
```

With Spring, you **invert** that control — you declare *what* you need, and the framework creates and supplies it:

```java
@Service
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class ClientService {
    private final ClientRepository clientRepository;  // "I need this" — Spring provides it
}
```

This is **Inversion of Control (IoC)**, and the mechanism that delivers the objects is **Dependency Injection (DI)**. You never call `new` on a service, repository, or controller.

**Why bother?** Loose coupling. `ClientService` doesn't know *how* its repository is built — Spring can swap in a mock for tests, a different implementation, or a proxy (for transactions/security) without changing your code.

### The Container & Beans

- A **bean** is any object that Spring creates and manages.
- The **ApplicationContext** (the IoC *container*) is the registry that holds every bean and knows how to wire them together.
- At startup Spring **scans** your packages for classes marked as beans, instantiates them, resolves their dependencies, and builds a complete object graph. This is the **bean lifecycle**: *instantiate → inject dependencies → ready to use → destroy on shutdown.*

```
Startup
   ↓
@ComponentScan finds @Component/@Service/@Repository/@Controller classes
   ↓
ApplicationContext instantiates each as a bean (singleton by default)
   ↓
Constructor injection wires dependencies between beans
   ↓
Application is ready to serve requests
```

By default beans are **singletons** — one shared instance for the whole app.

### Stereotype Annotations (how a class becomes a bean)

These all tell Spring "manage me as a bean." They're functionally similar but express *intent*, which aids readability and lets Spring apply layer-specific behavior:

| Annotation | Layer | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `@Component` | generic | The base stereotype — any Spring-managed bean |
| `@Service` | business logic | A `@Component` that marks a service-layer class |
| `@Repository` | data access | A `@Component` that also translates DB exceptions into Spring's `DataAccessException` |
| `@RestController` | web | `@Controller` + `@ResponseBody` — returns data (JSON), not view names |
| `@Configuration` | config | A class that defines beans via `@Bean` methods |

In this project: `ClientService`/`PolicyService` are `@Service`, the controllers are `@RestController`, `SecurityConfig`/`DataInitializer` are `@Configuration`. Repositories don't even need `@Repository` — Spring Data JPA registers them automatically.

### Constructor Injection (what `@RequiredArgsConstructor` really does)

Spring recommends **constructor injection**: dependencies are `final` fields set by a constructor. Lombok's `@RequiredArgsConstructor` generates that constructor for all `final` fields, so this:

```java
@Service
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class ClientService {
    private final ClientRepository clientRepository;
    private final AppUserRepository appUserRepository;
}
```

…is equivalent to writing the constructor by hand. When Spring builds `ClientService`, it sees the constructor needs those two beans and injects them. Constructor injection is preferred over field injection (`@Autowired` on a field) because it makes dependencies explicit, allows `final` (immutable) fields, and makes the class trivial to unit-test with plain `new`.

### `@SpringBootApplication` & Auto-Configuration

The entry point is tiny:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class PcApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(PcApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

`@SpringBootApplication` is actually **three annotations in one**:

| It includes | What it does |
|---|---|
| `@Configuration` | Marks this class as a source of bean definitions |
| `@ComponentScan` | Scans this package **and sub-packages** for beans (this is why your controllers/services are found automatically) |
| `@EnableAutoConfiguration` | The Spring Boot magic — inspects the classpath and auto-configures beans |

**Auto-configuration** means: because `spring-boot-starter-web` is on the classpath, Boot configures an embedded Tomcat, a `DispatcherServlet`, JSON conversion, etc. Because `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` + H2 are present, it configures a `DataSource`, an `EntityManager`, and transaction management. You only override what you need (in `application.properties`).

**Starters** are curated dependency bundles. `spring-boot-starter-web` pulls in Spring MVC, Jackson (JSON), validation, and Tomcat in one line — no version-juggling.

```

### How the layers connect

```
HTTP Request
    ↓
Controller   →   receives the RequestDTO, calls the service
    ↓
Service      →   maps DTO → Entity, calls the repository, maps Entity → ResponseDTO
    ↓
Repository   →   talks to the database
    ↓
Entity       →   represents a single row in a database table
```

Each layer only knows about the one directly below it. This keeps concerns separated and the code easier to test and maintain.

---

## The Request Lifecycle

When a request like `GET /clients/1` arrives, it passes through Spring's machinery before reaching your code. Understanding this pipeline explains *where* each annotation plugs in.

```
1. HTTP request hits the embedded Tomcat server
        ↓
2. Spring Security Filter Chain
   • authenticates the user (HTTP Basic → AppUserDetailsService)
   • populates SecurityContextHolder with the logged-in user
   • rejects with 401 if credentials are bad
        ↓
3. DispatcherServlet (Spring MVC's "front controller")
   • the single entry point for every request
        ↓
4. Handler Mapping
   • matches the URL + HTTP method to a controller method
   • GET /clients/{id} → ClientController.findById(...)
        ↓
5. @Valid runs (for POST/PUT) — fails fast with 400 if invalid
        ↓
6. Controller method executes → calls the Service
        ↓
7. Service runs business logic → calls the Repository
   • Spring Data JPA generates SQL, Hibernate executes it
        ↓
8. Entity → DTO mapping, value returned up the stack
        ↓
9. Jackson serializes the returned object to JSON
        ↓
10. HTTP response sent back to the client
```

If an exception is thrown anywhere in steps 6–8, the `@RestControllerAdvice` ([GlobalExceptionHandler](#exception-handling)) intercepts it and converts it to a clean JSON error response instead of a stack trace.

**Key insight:** you only write steps 6–8. Everything else — routing, JSON conversion, authentication, validation triggering, transaction boundaries — is provided by Spring and configured by annotations.

## Data Model

### Client — `clients` table

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | Long | Auto-generated primary key |
| `name` | String | First name |
| `lastName` | String | Last name |
| `email` | String | Contact email |
| `phone` | String | Phone number |
| `owner` | AppUser | The authenticated user who created this client (FK: `user_id`) |
| `policies` | Set\<Policy\> | Policies owned by this client (not exposed via API) |

### Policy — `policies` table

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | Long | Auto-generated primary key |
| `vehicleMake` | String | Vehicle manufacturer (e.g., "Toyota") |
| `vehicleModel` | String | Vehicle model (e.g., "Camry") |
| `vehicleYear` | Integer | Year the vehicle was manufactured |
| `vin` | String | Vehicle Identification Number |
| `licensePlate` | String | License plate number |
| `status` | Status | Current state: `ACTIVE`, `INACTIVE`, `PENDING`, or `CANCELLED` |
| `policyNumber` | String | Unique policy identifier |
| `premium` | Double | Monthly/annual cost |
| `startDate` | Date | Coverage start date |
| `endDate` | Date | Coverage end date |
| `client` | Client | The client this policy belongs to (FK: `client_id`) |

### Relationships

```
AppUser (1) ──────── (N) Client (1) ──────── (N) Policy
```

- `AppUser → Client`: one user can have many clients. `Client` stores `user_id` as a foreign key.
- `Client → Policy`: one client can have many policies. `Policy` stores `client_id` as a foreign key.
- In `Client.java`: `@ManyToOne` + `@JoinColumn(name = "user_id")` — "I belong to one user."
- In `Client.java`: `@OneToMany(mappedBy = "client")` — "I have many policies."
- In `Policy.java`: `@ManyToOne` + `@JoinColumn(name = "client_id")` — "I belong to one client."

## DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

The API never exposes JPA entities directly. Instead it uses DTOs — plain classes that carry only the data needed for each operation. This avoids infinite recursion from the bidirectional `Client ↔ Policy` relationship and decouples the API contract from the database model.

### Request DTOs (what comes IN)

| DTO | Fields |
|---|---|
| `ClientRequestDTO` | `name`, `lastName`, `email`, `phone` |
| `PolicyRequestDTO` | `vehicleMake`, `vehicleModel`, `vehicleYear`, `vin`, `licensePlate`, `status`, `policyNumber`, `premium`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `clientId` |

No `id` on request DTOs — the database generates it on insert, and the URL provides it on update.

Request DTOs also carry validation constraints (see [Validation](#validation) below).

### Response DTOs (what goes OUT)

| DTO | Fields |
|---|---|
| `ClientResponseDTO` | `id`, `name`, `lastName`, `email`, `phone` |
| `PolicyResponseDTO` | `id`, `vehicleMake`, `vehicleModel`, `vehicleYear`, `vin`, `licensePlate`, `status`, `policyNumber`, `premium`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `clientId`, `clientName` |

`PolicyResponseDTO` flattens the client relationship into `clientId` and `clientName` instead of embedding the full `Client` object.

### How mapping works in the service

Each service has two private helper methods that handle the conversion:

```java
// DTO → Entity (used in save and update)
private Client toEntity(ClientRequestDTO dto) {
    Client client = new Client();
    client.setName(dto.getName());
    // ...
    return client;
}

// Entity → DTO (used before returning to the controller)
private ClientResponseDTO toResponse(Client client) {
    return new ClientResponseDTO(
        client.getId(), client.getName(), ...
    );
}
```

## Spring Concepts in This Project

> This section shows the [fundamentals](#spring--spring-boot-fundamentals) applied to actual code in the project. If a concept here feels unfamiliar, jump back up to the fundamentals first.

### Dependency Injection

Spring manages object creation. Instead of writing `new ClientService()`, you declare a dependency and Spring injects it automatically:

```java
@RequiredArgsConstructor       // Lombok: generates a constructor for all final fields
public class ClientController {
    private final ClientService clientService;  // Spring injects this at startup
}
```

Spring builds a graph of all beans (objects it manages) and wires them together. You never call `new` on services or repositories.

### Entities and JPA Annotations

```java
@Entity                         // Marks this class as a JPA entity (maps to a DB table)
@Table(name = "clients")        // Sets the table name explicitly
@Id                             // Marks the primary key field
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)  // Auto-increment PK (DB-managed)
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "client") // One client → many policies
@ManyToOne                      // Many policies → one client
@JoinColumn(name = "client_id") // The FK column name in the policies table
@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)    // Stores enum as "ACTIVE" instead of 0, 1, 2...
```

### Lombok Annotations

```java
@Data                    // Generates getters, setters, equals, hashCode, and toString
@NoArgsConstructor       // Required by JPA — entities need a no-args constructor
@AllArgsConstructor      // Constructor with all fields — useful for creating DTOs
@RequiredArgsConstructor // Constructor for final fields — used for dependency injection
```

### Repositories (Spring Data JPA)

```java
public interface ClientRepository extends JpaRepository<Client, Long> { }
```

Extending `JpaRepository<Entity, IdType>` gives you these methods for free — no SQL needed:

| Method | What it does |
|---|---|
| `findAll()` | `SELECT * FROM clients` |
| `findById(id)` | `SELECT * FROM clients WHERE id = ?` |
| `save(entity)` | `INSERT` if new, `UPDATE` if `id` already exists |
| `deleteById(id)` | `DELETE FROM clients WHERE id = ?` |

You can also add **derived query methods** by naming them correctly:

```java
Optional<Policy> findByPolicyNumber(String policyNumber);
// Spring generates: SELECT * FROM policies WHERE policy_number = ?

List<Policy> findByClient(Client client);
// Spring generates: SELECT * FROM policies WHERE client_id = ?
```

### Security

Authentication is backed by the database. When a request arrives, Spring Security calls `AppUserDetailsService`, which loads the user from the `users` table. The password stored in the DB is BCrypt-hashed — plain text is never stored.

**Why DB-backed instead of in-memory?**
`InMemoryUserDetailsManager` hardcodes credentials in source code — there is no way to add, remove, or update users without redeploying. A DB-backed approach lets users be managed at runtime and is the prerequisite for linking each authenticated user to their own policies.

**How the pieces connect:**

```
HTTP Request (username + password)
    ↓
Spring Security intercepts the request
    ↓
DaoAuthenticationProvider
    ↓ calls
AppUserDetailsService.loadUserByUsername(username)
    ↓ queries
AppUserRepository.findByUsername(username)   →  users table
    ↓ returns UserDetails
DaoAuthenticationProvider compares the BCrypt hash
    ↓ grants or rejects access
```

**`AppUser` entity** (`entity/AppUser.java`) — the `users` table:

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class AppUser {
    @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @Column(unique = true, nullable = false)
    private String username;

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String password;   // BCrypt hash — never plain text

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String role;       // e.g. "ADMIN"
}
```

**`AppUserRepository`** (`repository/AppUserRepository.java`) — one derived query method is all that's needed:

```java
public interface AppUserRepository extends JpaRepository<AppUser, Long> {
    Optional<AppUser> findByUsername(String username);
    // Spring generates: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?
}
```

**`AppUserDetailsService`** (`security/AppUserDetailsService.java`) — the bridge between Spring Security and the DB:

```java
@Service
public class AppUserDetailsService implements UserDetailsService {

    @Override
    public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String username) {
        return appUserRepository.findByUsername(username)
                .map(u -> new User(
                        u.getUsername(),
                        u.getPassword(),
                        List.of(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("ROLE_" + u.getRole()))
                ))
                .orElseThrow(() -> new UsernameNotFoundException("User not found: " + username));
    }
}
```

**`SecurityConfig`** (`config/SecurityConfig.java`) — wires `DaoAuthenticationProvider` with the service and encoder:

```java
@Bean
public DaoAuthenticationProvider authenticationProvider(
        AppUserDetailsService userDetailsService,
        PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder) {
    DaoAuthenticationProvider provider = new DaoAuthenticationProvider(userDetailsService);
    provider.setPasswordEncoder(passwordEncoder);
    return provider;
}

@Bean
public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();  // hashes passwords — never store plain text
}
```

**`DataInitializer`** (`config/DataInitializer.java`) — seeds the default admin user at startup so the app is never locked out on a fresh DB:

```java
@Bean
CommandLineRunner seedUsers(AppUserRepository userRepository, PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder) {
    return args -> {
        if (userRepository.findByUsername("admin").isEmpty()) {
            userRepository.save(new AppUser(null, "admin", passwordEncoder.encode("admin123"), "ADMIN"));
        }
    };
}
```

The `if` check makes it idempotent — safe to run on every startup without creating duplicates.

---

## Authorization

Authentication answers "who are you?" Authorization answers "what are you allowed to see?"

Every client and policy is scoped to the authenticated user. A user can only read, create, update, or delete their own data — they can never access another user's records.

**Why this matters:** without authorization, any authenticated user could hit `GET /clients/1` and retrieve a client that belongs to someone else. With it, the service filters every query by the logged-in user, so IDs from other users return `404 Not Found`.

### How it works

Both `ClientService` and `PolicyService` call a private `getCurrentUser()` method on every operation:

```java
private AppUser getCurrentUser() {
    String username = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getName();
    return appUserRepository.findByUsername(username)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new UsernameNotFoundException("User not found: " + username));
}
```

`SecurityContextHolder` is a thread-local store that Spring Security populates after authenticating each request. `.getAuthentication().getName()` returns the logged-in username, which is then looked up in the DB to get the full `AppUser`.

### Scoped repository queries

The repositories use Spring Data JPA derived query methods to filter by owner automatically:

**`ClientRepository`:**
```java
List<Client> findByOwner(AppUser owner);
// SELECT * FROM clients WHERE user_id = ?

Optional<Client> findByIdAndOwner(Long id, AppUser owner);
// SELECT * FROM clients WHERE id = ? AND user_id = ?

boolean existsByIdAndOwner(Long id, AppUser owner);
// SELECT COUNT(*) > 0 FROM clients WHERE id = ? AND user_id = ?
```

**`PolicyRepository`:**
```java
List<Policy> findByClientOwner(AppUser owner);
// SELECT * FROM policies JOIN clients ON ... WHERE clients.user_id = ?

Optional<Policy> findByIdAndClientOwner(Long id, AppUser owner);
// SELECT * FROM policies JOIN clients ON ... WHERE policies.id = ? AND clients.user_id = ?

boolean existsByIdAndClientOwner(Long id, AppUser owner);
// SELECT COUNT(*) > 0 FROM policies JOIN clients ON ... WHERE policies.id = ? AND clients.user_id = ?
```

The `findByClientOwner` naming tells Spring Data JPA to follow the `client` relationship on `Policy` and then match the `owner` field on `Client` — it generates the JOIN automatically.

### Behavior per operation

| Operation | How authorization is applied |
|---|---|
| `GET /clients` | Returns only clients where `user_id` = current user |
| `GET /clients/{id}` | Returns `404` if the client belongs to another user |
| `POST /clients` | Sets `owner` = current user on the new client |
| `PUT /clients/{id}` | Checks `existsByIdAndOwner` before saving — `404` if not owned |
| `DELETE /clients/{id}` | Checks `existsByIdAndOwner` before deleting — `404` if not owned |
| `GET /policies` | Returns only policies whose client belongs to current user |
| `GET /policies/{id}` | Returns `404` if the policy's client belongs to another user |
| `POST /policies` | Validates that the `clientId` in the request belongs to current user |
| `PUT /policies/{id}` | Checks `existsByIdAndClientOwner` before saving — `404` if not owned |
| `DELETE /policies/{id}` | Checks `existsByIdAndClientOwner` before deleting — `404` if not owned |

> Returning `404` instead of `403` for unauthorized access is intentional — it avoids leaking that a resource exists at that ID.

---

## API Endpoints

All endpoints require HTTP Basic Auth: **username** `admin`, **password** `admin123`.

### Clients — `/clients`

| Method | URL | Body | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/clients` | — | `200 OK` | Get all clients |
| GET | `/clients/{id}` | — | `200 OK` / `404 Not Found` | Get a client by ID |
| POST | `/clients` | `ClientRequestDTO` | `201 Created` / `400 Bad Request` | Create a new client |
| PUT | `/clients/{id}` | `ClientRequestDTO` | `200 OK` / `400 Bad Request` | Update an existing client |
| DELETE | `/clients/{id}` | — | `204 No Content` | Delete a client by ID |

### Policies — `/policies`

| Method | URL | Body | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/policies` | — | `200 OK` | Get all policies |
| GET | `/policies/{id}` | — | `200 OK` / `404 Not Found` | Get a policy by ID |
| POST | `/policies` | `PolicyRequestDTO` | `201 Created` / `400 Bad Request` | Create a new policy |
| PUT | `/policies/{id}` | `PolicyRequestDTO` | `200 OK` / `400 Bad Request` | Update an existing policy |
| DELETE | `/policies/{id}` | — | `204 No Content` | Delete a policy by ID |

### HTTP Status Codes

Controllers return `ResponseEntity` to give proper HTTP status codes on every response:

```java
// 200 OK — found (service throws ResourceNotFoundException if not found)
return ResponseEntity.ok(clientService.findById(id));

// 201 Created — new resource
return ResponseEntity.status(201).body(clientService.save(dto));

// 204 No Content — deleted, nothing to return
clientService.delete(id);
return ResponseEntity.noContent().build();
```

404 and 500 errors are handled globally — see [Exception Handling](#exception-handling) below.

## Validation

Request DTOs are annotated with Jakarta Validation constraints. The controller methods use `@Valid` to trigger validation before the request reaches the service layer.

### `ClientRequestDTO`

| Field | Constraint | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `@NotBlank` | Must not be null or empty |
| `lastName` | `@NotBlank` | Must not be null or empty |
| `email` | `@NotBlank` + `@Email` | Must not be empty and must be a valid email format |
| `phone` | `@NotBlank` | Must not be null or empty |

### `PolicyRequestDTO`

| Field | Constraint | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `vehicleMake` | `@NotBlank` | Must not be null or empty |
| `vehicleModel` | `@NotBlank` | Must not be null or empty |
| `vehicleYear` | `@NotNull` | Must be provided |
| `vin` | `@NotBlank` | Must not be null or empty |
| `licensePlate` | `@NotBlank` | Must not be null or empty |
| `policyNumber` | `@NotBlank` | Must not be null or empty |
| `status` | `@NotNull` | Must be provided (`ACTIVE`, `INACTIVE`, `PENDING`, or `CANCELLED`) |
| `premium` | `@NotNull` | Must be provided |
| `startDate` | `@NotNull` | Must be provided |
| `endDate` | `@NotNull` | Must be provided |
| `clientId` | `@NotNull` | Must be provided |

### How it works

```java
// Controller — @Valid triggers constraint checks before the method body runs
@PostMapping
public ResponseEntity<ClientResponseDTO> save(@Valid @RequestBody ClientRequestDTO dto) { ... }
```

If any constraint fails, Spring throws `MethodArgumentNotValidException` before the service is called. `GlobalExceptionHandler` catches it and returns a `400 Bad Request` listing every failing field:

```json
{
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "email: must be a well-formed email address, name: must not be blank",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-14T10:00:00"
}
```

---

## Exception Handling

All errors return a consistent JSON body instead of stack traces. The three classes in `exception/` work together:

### `ResourceNotFoundException`

A custom unchecked exception thrown by the service layer when a lookup fails:

```java
// In PolicyService — when clientId doesn't exist
clientRepository.findById(dto.getClientId())
        .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("Client", id));
// message: "Client not found with id: 5"
```

### `ErrorResponse`

A Java record that defines the JSON shape of every error response:

```java
public record ErrorResponse(int status, String error, String message, LocalDateTime timestamp) {}
```

```json
{
  "status": 404,
  "error": "Not Found",
  "message": "Policy not found with id: 99",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-13T10:30:00"
}
```

### `GlobalExceptionHandler`

`@RestControllerAdvice` intercepts exceptions thrown anywhere in the controller layer and maps them to `ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse>`:

```java
@RestControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleNotFound(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(404)
                .body(ErrorResponse.of(404, "Not Found", ex.getMessage()));
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleValidation(MethodArgumentNotValidException ex) {
        String message = ex.getBindingResult().getFieldErrors().stream()
                .map(e -> e.getField() + ": " + e.getDefaultMessage())
                .collect(Collectors.joining(", "));
        return ResponseEntity.status(400)
                .body(ErrorResponse.of(400, "Bad Request", message));
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleGeneric(Exception ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(500)
                .body(ErrorResponse.of(500, "Internal Server Error", "An unexpected error occurred"));
    }
}
```

The `MethodArgumentNotValidException` handler returns a `400` with all failing field names and messages. The catch-all `Exception` handler ensures unexpected errors never leak a stack trace to the client.

## Running the App

**Prerequisites:** Java 21, Maven (or use the included `./mvnw` wrapper — no Maven installation needed)

### Development mode (H2 in-memory database)

The app starts in `dev` profile by default (`spring.profiles.active=dev` in `application.properties`).

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

- API: `http://localhost:8080`
- H2 Console (browser): `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
  - JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:policydb`
  - Username: `sa` | Password: *(leave empty)*

### Production mode (PostgreSQL)

```bash
export DB_USER=your_db_user
export DB_PASS=your_db_password
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=prod
```

Make sure a PostgreSQL database named `policydb` exists on `localhost:5432`.

---

## Configuration Profiles

Spring profiles let you have different configs per environment without changing code.

| File | Profile | Database | Schema behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `application.properties` | (base) | — | Sets active profile |
| `application-dev.properties` | `dev` | H2 in-memory | Recreated on each start (`create-drop`) |
| `application-prod.properties` | `prod` | PostgreSQL | Migrated on start (`update`) |

---

## Deployment

The app is containerized and deploys to any platform that runs a Docker image (Railway, Render, Fly.io, etc.).

### Environment variables (production)

The `prod` profile reads all secrets and connection details from the environment — nothing sensitive is committed:

| Variable | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` | Selects the prod profile | `prod` |
| `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` | JDBC URL of the database | `jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/policydb` |
| `DB_USER` | Database username | `policy` |
| `DB_PASS` | Database password | `secret` |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | Seeded admin login | `admin` |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Seeded admin password | *(a real secret)* |
| `PORT` | Port to bind to (injected by most PaaS) | `8080` |

### Test the production build locally with Docker Compose

This runs the app against a real PostgreSQL — the same setup as production — so you can catch prod-only issues before deploying:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

- API: `http://localhost:8080` (login `admin` / `change-me-locally`)
- Health check: `http://localhost:8080/actuator/health` → `{"status":"UP"}`
- Tear down (and wipe the DB volume): `docker compose down -v`

### Deploy to a PaaS (Railway / Render / Fly.io)

The flow is the same on every platform:

1. **Push this repo to GitHub** (the platform builds from the `Dockerfile`).
2. **Provision a PostgreSQL database** on the platform — it gives you a connection URL, username, and password.
3. **Create the web service** pointing at your repo. The platform detects the `Dockerfile` and builds the image.
4. **Set the environment variables** from the table above (`SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod`, the DB values, and a strong `ADMIN_PASSWORD`). Most platforms inject `PORT` automatically.
5. **Set the health check path** to `/actuator/health` so the platform knows when the app is ready.
6. **Deploy.** On first boot, `DataInitializer` seeds the admin user and Hibernate creates the tables.

### Production hardening checklist

What's done and what's left as you take this further:

- [x] Secrets read from environment variables (no credentials in source)
- [x] Admin password configurable per environment
- [x] Health endpoint for platform probes (`/actuator/health`)
- [x] Binds to the platform-injected `PORT`
- [x] Runs as a non-root user in the container
- [ ] Replace `ddl-auto=update` with **Flyway** migrations (versioned, reviewable schema changes)
- [ ] Add a real user-registration flow instead of a single seeded admin
- [ ] Restrict the H2 console / disable it entirely in prod
- [ ] Add CORS config if a browser frontend will call the API

## Running Tests

```bash
./mvnw test
```

### Test Structure

```
src/test/java/com/pc/pc/
├── PcApplicationTests.java          # Context load smoke test
└── service/
    ├── ClientServiceTest.java       # Unit tests for ClientService
    └── PolicyServiceTest.java       # Unit tests for PolicyService
```

All service tests are pure unit tests using **Mockito** — no Spring context, no database. Repositories are mocked, so tests run fast and in isolation.

### `ClientServiceTest`

| Test | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `findAll_returnsMappedList` | Returns a mapped list of `ClientResponseDTO` with correct field values |
| `findById_returnsResponse_whenFound` | Returns the correct response when the client exists |
| `findById_throwsException_whenNotFound` | Throws `ResourceNotFoundException` for a missing ID |
| `save_persistsAndReturnsResponse` | Calls `clientRepository.save()` and maps the result to a response DTO |
| `update_setsIdAndSaves` | Sets the ID on the entity before saving (ensures UPDATE, not INSERT) |
| `update_throwsException_whenNotFound` | Throws `ResourceNotFoundException` when the client ID doesn't exist |
| `delete_callsDeleteById` | Delegates to `clientRepository.deleteById()` |

### `PolicyServiceTest`

| Test | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `findAll_returnsMappedList` | Returns a mapped list of `PolicyResponseDTO` with correct field values |
| `findById_returnsResponse_whenFound` | Returns the correct response when the policy exists |
| `findById_throwsException_whenNotFound` | Throws `ResourceNotFoundException` for a missing ID |
| `save_persistsAndReturnsResponse` | Calls `policyRepository.save()` and maps the result to a response DTO |
| `save_throwsException_whenClientNotFound` | Throws `ResourceNotFoundException` when the `clientId` doesn't exist |
| `update_setsIdAndSaves` | Sets the ID on the entity before saving (ensures UPDATE, not INSERT) |
| `update_throwsException_whenNotFound` | Throws `ResourceNotFoundException` when the policy ID doesn't exist |
| `delete_callsDeleteById` | Delegates to `policyRepository.deleteById()` |

### Test Dependencies

All test tooling comes bundled with `spring-boot-starter-test` — no extra dependencies needed:

| Tool | Role |
|---|---|
| **JUnit 5** | Test runner (`@Test`, `@BeforeEach`, `@ExtendWith`) |
| **Mockito** | Mocking repositories (`@Mock`, `@InjectMocks`, `when(...).thenReturn(...)`, `verify(...)`) |
| **AssertJ** | Fluent assertions (`assertThat(...)`, `assertThatThrownBy(...)`) |
| **spring-security-test** | Security context support for future controller-layer tests |

## Study Questions

Test your understanding. Try to answer from memory, then check against the code and the sections above.

### Core Spring
1. What is the difference between Spring and Spring Boot? Name two things Spring Boot adds.
2. What does "Inversion of Control" actually invert? Who creates objects in a Spring app?
3. What is a *bean*? What is the *ApplicationContext*?
4. Why is constructor injection preferred over field injection? How does `@RequiredArgsConstructor` enable it?
5. `@SpringBootApplication` is composed of three annotations — name them and what each does.
6. What is auto-configuration, and how does adding `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` trigger it?
7. By default, how many instances of a `@Service` bean exist in the application?

### Web Layer
8. Trace a `POST /clients` request through the [request lifecycle](#the-request-lifecycle). Where does `@Valid` run, and what happens if it fails?
9. What is the difference between `@RestController` and `@Controller`?
10. What does `@RequestBody` do, and which library converts the JSON?

### Data Layer
11. `ClientRepository` is just an empty interface — why does it work without any implementation?
12. How does Spring Data JPA turn `findByIdAndOwner` into SQL? What about `findByClientOwner`?
13. On the `Client`–`Policy` relationship, which entity owns the foreign key, and which annotation marks it?
14. Why does `@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)` matter — what breaks if you remove it?

### Cross-cutting
15. How does `@RestControllerAdvice` catch an exception thrown inside a service method?
16. How does the app know *who* is making a request, and where is that identity stored?
17. Why does the API return `404` (not `403`) when you request another user's policy?
18. Why do the service unit tests run without a database or a running Spring context?

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer key (click to expand)</strong></summary>

1. Spring = the IoC container + modules (needs manual config). Spring Boot adds auto-configuration, starter dependencies, and an embedded server.
2. It inverts *who creates and wires objects* — the framework does, not your code. See [IoC & DI](#inversion-of-control--dependency-injection-the-1-concept).
3. A bean is any object Spring creates and manages; the ApplicationContext is the container/registry that holds them.
4. It makes dependencies explicit, allows `final` immutable fields, and enables plain-`new` unit testing. `@RequiredArgsConstructor` generates a constructor for all `final` fields.
5. `@Configuration` (bean definitions), `@ComponentScan` (find beans in sub-packages), `@EnableAutoConfiguration` (configure beans from the classpath).
6. Boot inspects the classpath at startup; seeing JPA + a DB driver, it auto-creates a `DataSource`, `EntityManager`, and transaction manager.
7. One — beans are singletons by default.
8. Tomcat → Security filter → DispatcherServlet → handler mapping → `@Valid` (before the method body) → controller → service → repository. If `@Valid` fails, Spring throws `MethodArgumentNotValidException` and the handler returns `400` before the service runs.
9. `@RestController` = `@Controller` + `@ResponseBody`; it returns data serialized to JSON instead of a view/template name.
10. It deserializes the JSON request body into a Java object; Jackson does the conversion.
11. Spring Data JPA generates a proxy implementation at runtime from the `JpaRepository` interface.
12. It parses the method name into a query: `findByIdAndOwner` → `WHERE id = ? AND user_id = ?`. `findByClientOwner` follows the `client` relationship then matches `owner`, producing a JOIN.
13. `Policy` owns the FK (`client_id`) via `@ManyToOne` + `@JoinColumn`; `Client` has the inverse `@OneToMany(mappedBy = "client")`.
14. Without it, JPA stores the enum's ordinal int (0,1,2…). Reordering or inserting enum values would silently corrupt existing rows; `STRING` stores the name and is stable.
15. `@RestControllerAdvice` registers a global advice bean; Spring routes any exception bubbling out of a controller to the matching `@ExceptionHandler`.
16. The Security filter authenticates the request and stores the user in `SecurityContextHolder` (thread-local); services read it via `getCurrentUser()`.
17. Returning `404` avoids leaking that a resource exists at that ID for another user. See [Authorization](#authorization).
18. They use Mockito to mock repositories and `SecurityContextHolder`, so no Spring context or DB is started — fast, isolated unit tests.
